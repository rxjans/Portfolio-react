# Portfolio Website using React.js
Welcome to my portfolio website (ReactJs)! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a dynamic and interactive manner.

## About React.js
React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build complex UIs for web applications. React utilizes a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI in response to changes, resulting in faster rendering and improved performance.

## Creation of React Apps
To create a React app, you can use tools like Create React App, which provides a pre-configured setup for building React applications. Simply run npx create-react-app my-app to create a new React project. Then, you can start building your app by creating components, managing state, and handling events.

## Deployment
Once your React app is ready, you can deploy it to various hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. For example, to deploy your app to GitHub Pages, you can follow these steps:

* Build your React app by running npm run build.

* Install the gh-pages package by running npm install gh-pages.

* Add "homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository" to your package.json file, replacing username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of your repository.

* Add the following scripts to your package.json file:

## script code for deployment
```
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```
Deploy your app by running npm run deploy.

Your React app should now be deployed to GitHub Pages at the specified homepage URL.
